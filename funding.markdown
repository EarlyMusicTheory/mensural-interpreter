# Funding acknowledgements

The project team acknowledges with gratitude funding from a Research Grant awarded in **????** by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). This strand of this project runs until 31 March 2022.

Statement from the AHRC website:

‘The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funds world-class, independent researchers in a wide range of subjects: ancient history, modern dance, archaeology, digital content, philosophy, English literature, design, the creative and performing arts, and much more. This financial year the AHRC will spend approximately £98m to fund research and postgraduate training in collaboration with a number of partners. The quality and range of research supported by this investment of public funds not only provides social and cultural benefits but also contributes to the economic success of the UK. For further information on the AHRC, please go to: <www.ahrc.ac.uk.>’
