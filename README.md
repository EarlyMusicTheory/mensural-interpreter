# About

This is MeRIT, the Mensural Rhythm Interpretation Tool, is a client-side Javascript tool that interprets the rhythmic notation of pre-modern polyphonic music using rules derived from the writings of the fifteenth-century music theorist and composer Johannes Tinctoris (c.1435–1511).

MeRIT can be used through the MeRIT website: [interpreter.earlymusictheory.org](https://interpreter.earlymusictheory.org/)
