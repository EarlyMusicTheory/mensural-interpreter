- rule: rest
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: Rests can't be altered or imperfected.

- rule: coloration

- rule: I.2.a.PerfDot
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: Dot of augmentation following a regularly perfect note.

- rule: simpleDot
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: Simple dot of augmentation.

- rule: unalterableImperfect
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: Any note that is not regularly perfect and that is not a direct part of a ternary note is unalterable imperfect.

- rule: unalteredImperfectAfterLarger
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: An alterable note preceded by a larger note is followed by a larger note and regularly imperfect.

- rule: A.2b
  type: beatIndependent

- rule: unalteredImperfect
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: A regularly imperfect alterable note that is not followed by a larger note.

- rule: I.2.b.antesim
  type: beatIndependent
  definition: If a regularly perfect note is followed immediately by a note or rest at the same level, the former cannot be imperfected.

- rule: I.3
  type: imperfection
  definition: A regularly perfect note that falls on the first subunit of its own unit and is followed by any larger note or rest is ipso facto perfect.

- rule: I.4a
  type: imperfection
  definition: A regularly perfect note that falls on the first subunit of its own unit and is followed, before the next note or rest of its own value or larger or before a dot of division, by the equivalent of one note that would imperfect it is imperfected from behind by that note or equivalent.

  type: imperfection

- rule: I.4bii
  type: imperfection

- rule: I.5
  type: imperfection
  definition: A regularly perfect note that falls on the first subunit of its own unit and is followed, before the next note or rest of its own value or larger or before a dot of division, by the equivalent of two notes that would imperfect it is perfect, provided that the last of these can be altered.

- rule: I.5-add
  type: imperfection

- rule: I.5-literalunits
  type: imperfection

- rule: I.6
  type: imperfection
  definition: A regularly perfect note that falls on the first subunit of its own unit and is followed, before the next note or rest of its own value or larger or before a dot of division, by the equivalent 3 or 6 notes that would imperfect it is perfect (even if the last note of this series is potentially alterable), unless a dot of division forces it to be imperfected (rule I.4).

- rule: I.6-literalunits
  type: imperfection
  definition: Trusting in alteration

- rule: I.8
  type: imperfection
  definition: A regularly perfect note that falls on the second subunit of its own unit is imperfected from ahead by what would imperfect it, either immediately or by syncope.

  type: imperfection

- rule: I.9b
  type: imperfection

- rule: A.1
  type: alteration
  definition: An alterable note on the second beat gets altered.

- rule: A.2
  type: alteration
  definition: An alterable note that is preceded by a dot of division followed by the equivalent of its own regular value and followed by a note or rest of the perfect unit next larger is altered.
