# Explanation of rules

## Beat independent rules

In order of execution:

rest
: Rests can't be altered or imperfected.

coloration
: Colored notation is assumed to be simple duple and labelled accordingly.

I.2.a.PerfDot
: Dot of augmentation following a regularly perfect note.

simpleDot
: Simple dot of augmentation.

unalterableImperfect
: Any note that is not regularly perfect and that is not a direct part of a ternary note is unalterable imperfect.

unalteredImperfectAfterLarger
: An alterable note preceded by a larger note is followed by a larger note and regularly imperfect.

A.2b
: ???

unalteredImperfect
: A regularly imperfect alterable note that is not followed by a larger note.

I.2.b.antesim
: If a regularly perfect note is followed immediately by a note or rest at the same level, the former cannot be imperfected.

## Analysis depending on beat positions

### Imperfection

I.3
: A regularly perfect note that falls on the first subunit of its own unit and is followed by any larger note or rest is ipso facto perfect.

I.4a

I.4b

I.4bi

I.4bii

I.5

I.5-add

I.5-literalunits

I.6

I.6-literalunits
: Trusting in alteration

I.8
: A regularly perfect note that falls on the second subunit of its own unit is imperfected from ahead by what would imperfect it, either immediately or by syncope.

I.9a

I.9b

### Alteration

A.1
: An alterable note on the second beat gets altered.

A.2
: An alterable note that is preceded by a dot of division followed by the equivalent of its own regular value and followed by a note or rest of the perfect unit next larger is altered.
